# Security Policy

## Supported Use

This project is intended to run as a public, read-only MeshCore Australia live map.
The public deployment should use `PUBLIC_MODE=true`, which exposes only:

- `/healthz`
- `/api/v1/public/state`
- `/ws/public`
- the static dashboard

Internal debug APIs must stay disabled for public deployments.

## Private Runtime Data

Never commit or share:

- `.env` or any environment file containing real values
- MQTT usernames or passwords
- MeshCore private keys
- channel secrets used for message decoding
- live SQLite databases, WAL files, or SHM files
- local `data/config.yaml` files with operator-only overrides
- raw packet captures copied from live traffic

The repository ignore rules are configured to keep these files out of git, but
check `git status --ignored` before publishing.

## Reporting Issues

If you find a security or privacy issue, do not open a public issue with
credentials, packet data, or private configuration. Contact the maintainer
privately first, then share only the minimum sanitized reproduction details.

## Public Data Boundary

Public API responses are expected to omit public keys, packet hashes, raw packet
summaries, path hex, observer public keys, and resolver debug reasons. Any
change that touches public response shaping must keep the privacy tests passing.
